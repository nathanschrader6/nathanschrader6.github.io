    <p>Hour of Code teaches students from elementary to high school how to write simple software.
      Age appropriate lessons for all ages of child are available, revolving around tv, book, and video game characters, progressing into concepts of
      increasing difficulty.
      They provide both software and educational materials for teachers to include computer science in the classroom.

  <p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation designs and produces small, inexpencive computers. These computers are very minimal, using
    smart phone hardware on a single circut board, but provide a simple platform for educators to use in the classroom.
    The Raspberry Pi Foundation works with Hour of Code to help teachers include programming in their carriculum.

    <p>The Arduino is a line of small circuit boards produced by the Arduino corporation.
      They can be used for electronic projects ranging from simply blinking an LED to internet-connected
      coffee pots that automatically brew every morning. The Arduino can be wired up to a wide variety of sensors, motors, and other ways of interacting with the real world. To use one, the board is hooked up to a computer via USB and code uploaded through the Arduino software. Everything on the board is open-source meaning anybody can look at the code and hardware specifications. This has lead to dozens of specialized compatible boards that can, for example, be sewn into clothing or control a robot.
      These boards are used both for easy electronic development and teaching.
