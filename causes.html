      <a href="https://code.org/">Hour of code:</a>
    <p>Hour of Code teaches students from elementary to high school how to write simple software.
      Age appropriate lessons for all ages of child are available, revolving around tv, book, and video game characters, progressing into concepts of
      increasing difficulty.
      They provide both software and educational materials for teachers to include computer science in the classroom.

          <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation:</a>
          <p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation designs and produces small, inexpencive computers. These computers are very minimal, using
            smart phone hardware on a single circut board, but provide a simple platform for educators to use in the classroom.
            The Raspberry Pi Foundation works with Hour of Code to help teachers include programming in their carriculum.

      <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino:</a>
      <p>The Arduino is a line of small circuit boards produced by the Arduino corporation.
        They can be used for electronic projects ranging from simply blinking an LED to internet-connected
        coffee pots that automatically brew every morning. The Arduino can be wired up to a wide variety of sensors, motors, and other ways of interacting with the real world. To use one, the board is hooked up to a computer via USB and code uploaded through the Arduino software. Everything on the board is open-source meaning anybody can look at the code and hardware specifications. This has lead to dozens of specialized compatible boards that can, for example, be sewn into clothing or control a robot.
        These boards are used both for easy electronic development and teaching.

        <a href="https://opensource.org">Open Source:</a>
        <p>Open Source software is Software developed in the public domain. The name says it all,
           the source code is open to viewing, copying, and reuse by the public.
           Also known as free software (free as in free speech), open source code allows a level of
           freedom not found in non-free or proprietary software. For example, open source software can be copied
           and used in other projects, redistributed, or "forked" and a new project started. For the average,
           non-developer, free software has the advantage of usually being free of charge,
           not needing to license software, and having the interest of a community at heart.
            Having lots of eyes on the code ensures that bugs are squashed quickly and vulnerabilities
             are patched in a timely manner. Some of the most important pieces of software are under an open source license
          including; Firefox, Linux, Inkscape, Docker, Apache, and others.
