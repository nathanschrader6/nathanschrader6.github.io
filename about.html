    My name is Nathan Schrader, I am a student at Eastern Washington University
    and am a Computer Science major. Last year I became a part of the Running
    Start program at EWU which is a way for people in 11th and 12th grade to
    study in the university full time. I enjoy building and making things
    in general. I try to avoid buying when I can create, my interests
    include creating electronics projects such as DIY microphones and speakers
    as well as Arduino microcontroler programing projects. Other than that I
    enjoy hacking on computer hardware and software, I'm an open source enthusiest
    and try to use free/open software whenever possible. This entire web page
    was developed useing Linux, command-line git, github.com(git and hosting), GIMP, and the
    Gnome-Builder IDE. Linux (Arch in particular)is my opperating system of choice
    on my daily desktop, as well as development,platform. Linux offers me the
    freedom, stability, and security to do what I need. Other than the digital world I am first
    and formost a follower of Christ, a person trying to be a light in a dark world.
    I love being outside, being with with friends, and making music.
